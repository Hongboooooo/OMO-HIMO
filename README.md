# OMO-HIMO
Modify and Retrain omo 1st network for multiple objects manipulation generation 
> Task Description: given mutliple objects geometries and motion sequences, predict the position sequence of two hands  
> Current Progress:  
>   1. Built up the data processing functions
>   2. Built up the diffusion network's training and evaluation framework  
>   3. Modified architecture by explanding the object encoder channel  

Visual Result:
> Two green dots in the gif below are the inferred result of network
